# Eggs
## EggBoom.cpp
- this is an component that is used for **attacking eggs**
- it is setted to the entity and after the setted ***amount of seconds*** it will ***explode*** and ***kill*** the entities that are hitted
## ChickenAttack.h
- just ***stores an pointer*** to an entity of the ***spawned egg*** _(and null if there is no egg spawned)_
- this helps because if the pointer is ***null*** it means that there is ***no egg*** so we can let the player ***spawn aother*** and if it isn't we will ***not*** let the player ***spawn an egg agin***
